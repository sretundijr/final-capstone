This is the client side for Technician assist.  View the project [here](https://www.technician-assist.com/)

Technician Assist aims to provide the best customer experience when visiting a participating automotive repair facility.  This app allows a service advisor to send a questionnaire to a customer who has recently scheduled an appointment for vehicle service.  The customer recieves an email containing a link to the questionnaire. The questionnaire allows the customer to select an issue category and answer important questions that will allow the technician working on the vehicle to get a better idea of what is going on.  One of the biggest challenges within small and large repair facilities is communication between the customer, advisor, and technician.  This communication chain is fragile and breaks down frequently (no pun intended).  Technicians may find themselves chasing an issue that is completely unrelated to the systems they are testing due to this communication break down.

Currently, Technician Assist is in MVP stage and features only core functionality.  The communication chain is established using email communication.  The advisor has the ability to send an email to a customer with a link to the questinnaire.  Once the customer completes this questionnaire, the advisor dashboard is updated indicating a returned questionnaire.  The advisor can review the questionniare and send a link to the technician via email.  The technician clicks the link and is directed straight to the questionnaire.  No signing in, no navigating through a dashboard; technician time is valuable and this app will not be a burden.

The questionnaire is mobile friendly, this gives the customer an opportunity to fill out the questionnaire without being inconvienced by having to go to a computer.  The goal is to provide the customer the best possbile experience while maximizing technician efficiency and driving greater profits.

Lets not forget the advisors time.  In order to send a questionnaire the advisor needs only to sign in once daily fill out three parameters in a form; customer email, name, appointment date and click send.  Once the questionnaire is returned the advisor is two button clicks away from sending an email to the technician.  The advisor will have to manually enter the technicians email address each time they want to send a questionnaire to a technician.  Storing technician info was not part of the MVP scope, but will be added as a feature in a later version.
